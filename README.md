# Ruby Programming by Example
I was browsing for a workbook of ruby problems. I found one on Leanpub.com my absolute favorite site
for developer books, written by developers for developers. This repository will be my repo to store 
all of completed problems that are coming from this workbook. The book consists of maybe 50 problems
in total and is geared towards the new ruby programmer who is just starting out and wants to learn through 
completing ruby problems of varying complexity. It will take a new learner from just knowing syntax
to solving critical thinking problems up to a facebook interview complexity. 

Im just simply having fun, learning how to think critically about programming problems and figuring things out.
